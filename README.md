# modern-data-stack-pipeline
A modern end-to-end data pipeline that extracts raw data using Python, loads it into Snowflake, transforms it with dbt, orchestrates all workflows using Apache Airflow, and visualizes insights in Metabase. This project demonstrates the full modern data stack — from ingestion to analytics — with clean, scalable, and production-ready practices.
